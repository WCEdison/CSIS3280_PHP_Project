------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Reconfirm key design feature
Format: Store front 
Major tech decision
Use Laravel
Use Github to publish webpage
Find Food/Grocery API
Use local database
Design direction
Purpose:
Grocery Store
Features:
Login -> As manager
Customer
View
Filter (Basically Sql select, use desc/asec, sort by)
Management (use from last demo)
Add
Edit
Delete
Database
2 x Unrelated Tables
Admin login 
Product
Question to ask: How much weight is this project and when is the deadline
If high then we add more feature (Might expand if scope expands)
Otherwise we keep current feature + grocery api + login for admin + database editing for admin 


2. Logistics: How to communicate, Github project and publishing
Whatsapp to do normal communication  
Error
To dos
Teams for bigger meeting → On demand only (one more handing it in)
Github + Github desktop
Use [Visio] for Class Diagram


---------------------------------------------
